User Flow:
User logs in, sees a list of their financial institutions on the left sidebar, along with a list of their budget categories. The bulk of the page is a large table populated with their most recent financial transactions, pulled directly from their institutions. It is here that a user can assign a transaction to a budget category. When the user clicks on a specific financial institution, the table is “filtered” to show transactions from that institution only. The same can be done with each budget category. There are options in the navbar to go back to the home page (most recent transactions) and to contact the developers for any issues.
